# Application Name

Basic wiki that allows the user to edit articles and add articles as well.


## Getting Started

The final product has 4 different pages that look very similar. [pages_sketch]("sketches/pages_skeetch")

In order to make it all work. First the html layout for the entry pages must be made. Then the index page must have links to all of these entries. Afterwards the edit page must be made and must properly change the information of an entry. Adding a new page must be saved into a list.
